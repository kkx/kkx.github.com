    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>图片中的物体探测一直是比较热的课题，通过物体的检测可以对图片自动生成标签以及分类，可以很好的用在图片检索的领域。在做的毕业设计(也是论文)就涉及到这方面的。今天看一篇叫<a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vilem/cvpr2009.pdf">Class-Speciﬁc Hough Forests for Object Detection</a>的state of the art，发现原来导师叫我用到的方法和这个差不多，只是增加了某些小trick用于对特定的数据集优化。</p>

<p>Hough Forests。 其实就是一个random forests 也就是随机森林,每条数据是一小块图片的description(patch) 树的每个节点对数据的分割通过information gain，努力把相同类的patch和相似的patch分到同一个枝头上去。每次通过数据集,随机采集部分features用于分割，每个这些features的分割点生成一个pool。然后对每个feature的分割点做一个信息量的检测，就像一个标准的random forests一样， 这里信息量的计算通过一下程式(这么说比较台湾腔 夯):
$$
Entropy({c_i}) = -c\cdot \log c -(1-c)\cdot \log(1-c)
$$
这里c就是patch是属于物体c的概率，1-c就是negative cases。o
简单吧，其实在原来的论文里还有一个东西，就是entropy只是衡量split的优差的其中一个feature，还有一个feature是offset也就是patch到中心点的距离，通过增加这个衡量点，相似距离的patch会在一起哦。测试的结果是，加上这个feature，precision会有很好的提高。
怎么计算这个feature，其实很简单，用Root mean square(RMS)把split后的patch到中心点的距离计算下，split之后小的RMS更优。到达叶子的数据，每个patch会有一次投票的机会给出中心点的位置。 </p>

<p>训练之后，每个测试图片会被分成不同的patch，通过hough forests 到达叶子的patch生成不同中心点的位置(根据在那叶子里的中心点patch). 最后，通过投票，某个物体的中心点的票数会很高，就这样我们就能找到一个物体的中心点了。 如果一个patch是不是物体的一部分，生成的中心点是错误的，但是中心点的位置其实是随机的，也就是说如果有很多很多非物体patch生成的map是没有一个明显的中心点的。而如果有很多物体中某部位的patch，生成出来的中心点是有一个很大的偏向性的，往往会往某一个中心聚拢。</p>

<p>这里有一个问题就是怎么计算一个patch到中心点的位置。首先训练数据一定得是每张图片只有一个物体。每个patch计算自己中心到物体的中心并保存x轴和y轴的移动。</p>

<p>道理很简单，给我的代码。
opencv这个库让我又爱又恨啊，很好用，很多很复杂的算法只要一行代码就ok了，但是python binding里有很多bug。而且很多错误你不一行行代码拆下来是不会看到的。。。
首先，不想使用论文里的hough forest，因为感觉上在opencv里你得自己hack下，不值得。第二貌似没找到patch的descriptor，所以在自己的实验里，只用到了特征点的descriptors，像sift和surf。使用这个的有点就是，可以做到orientation insensitive和scale insensitive。 其实，论文里的方法是没有能做到scale insensitive的，因为距离是个relative的东西，论文里，通过使用不同的scale进行测试，获得最优的结果作为最终结果。 而view insensitive更没有解决方法，按他们的方法，只有通过增加不同view的训练数据来弥补吧。</p>

<p>但是！导师教给我的方法能避免这个问题。首先sift和surf本身是view insensitive的，而在计算距离的时候通过对特征点本身的大小对距离做个归一化，这样就能让系统获得对不同大小的物体的识别能力。 
另外一个trick就是sift之类的特征点自己会带有gradient orientation,也就是梯度方向，这个信息是在计算距离的时候必须使用到的。因为相同descriptor的特征点可能会有不同的梯度方向，如果你只使用了图片原始的x和y轴保存距离的话，预测的中心点会偏离本来的实际位置。下面的图片就是个case: 
<img class="center" src="http://kkx.github.com/images/circle.png" width="680" height="420" title="梯度方向" ></p>

<p>我有一个圆圈，底部是白色的，如果是sift当特征点的检测的话，每个圆圈边上的点的特征值是一样的，而他们的梯度方向可能会不一样，如果不使用梯度方向的话，a作为训练的数据，而比作为测试数据，中心点预测的结果会在圆圈的外面(细线部分)。
如果要避免以上问题，只有通过<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix">rotation matrix</a> 让每个特征点更具自己的梯度方向生成自己的x和y轴。 并且每个特征点的相对于中心点的距离要在新的x和y轴上进行计算。</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> x_{new} = x \cdot cos(angle) - y \cdot sin(angle) </script>
  </li>
  <li>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> y_{new} = x \cdot sin(angle) + y \cdot cos(angle) </script>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>如果需要从新轴返回到原始的x y轴只需要把angle乘以-1就可以了, 上面的angle是以radian为单位的。</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://kkx.github.com/images/circle2.png" width="680" height="420" title="rotation matrix" >
假设上图是更具特征点的梯度方向做的x和y轴的转换，转换之后，可以发现点离圆圈的中心的距离不变，但是在x轴和y轴的移动发生了变化。</p>

<p>下面是测试方法的代码，包括训练和测试。数据集的话是使用<a href="http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/Data/Car/">ucic</a>里的汽车数据，训练集里有positive cases 和negative cases，这里我只用到了positive cases。也没有是用到hough forest做训练，只用到了最近友邻。 每次选择最相近的友邻做出投票。在训练数据里，所有的车子中心点都在图的当中，因为每张图片里的车子几乎撑满整张图，而所有图片的尺寸都是40x100，在训练数据里，有两部分，一部分是没有scale变化的车子数据库，而另外一部分里车子的大小会有变化，用于测试方法对于scale变化的鲁棒性。 </p>

<p>一大坨kernel变量，其实就是matlab的disk filter: fspecial(‘disk’, 20) opencv里就没有合适的filter可以用来平滑图片的!。 这里使用到了flann用来做最近友邻的模型，由于数据不是特别大，所以这里也没什么优化。在训练的时候，会把每个特征点距离到中心点的距离计算一下，计算完会根据特征点的大小把距离缩放一下，而当在测试的时候也会根据每个特征点的大小把距离放大。这样就能达到scale insensitive的目的了。 每个特征点会根据友邻做投票，投票的结果会映射到一个和图片一样大小的map上面。 通过filter2d过滤之后，会出现一大坨模糊的东西，哪里最亮哪里的投票数就最多，是中心点的可能性也最大。</p>

<p>下面就是一些实验图片的结果。

<p>貌似结果很好的，但是其实不是的，因为这里没用到false cases，会出现很多false positive，而且，由于是使用sift detector, 本身控制不了哪些特征点是需要的哪些是不需要的，在测试后的时候，如果测试图片的某个非物体部位的特征点很多的话(细节比较多)，会产生很多假票, 像最后一张图的两根柱子。在下次的试验力，一定得吧那些false cases包含到训练库里，当测试数据碰到的一个false case的票，直接把权值归0，这样的话应该能对结果有很大的改观。还有就是这里，每张投票的权值都是1，可以根据友邻的距离设置投票的权值，近的投票全职大，这样结果应该会好一些。 </p>

<p>opencv用起来真的没有matlab舒服，就连一个类似matlab的imregionalmax函数都没有，这个函数可以计算local maximum，这样的话，选取峰值最高的几个点作为预测结果会有很理想的结果。所以这套代码在这里也不能用来获得和真实中心点做比较。</p>
